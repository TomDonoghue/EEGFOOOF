# Notebooks

The following notebooks step through the analyses for EEGFOOOF.

### 01-ProcessEEG

This notebook sets out the processing for the dataset, pre-processing the EEG data, and calculating features for group level analyses.

Note that this notebook is superceded by the `process_eeg` script, which runs the group level processing.

### 02-GroupAnalysis-Rest

This notebook analyses the resting state data, describing and examining spectral features during rest.

This notebook does the analyses and creates the plots for Figure 5 of the paper.

### 03-GroupAnalysis-Behaviour

This notebook analyses the behavioural responses for the working memory task.

### 04-GroupAnalysis-Task

This notebook analyses the task related data, examining if features from parameterized power spectra can be used to predict behavioural responses.

This notebook does the analyses and creates the plots for Figure 6 of the paper.
